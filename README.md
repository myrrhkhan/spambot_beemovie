EXERCISE CAUTION!

For those with no Python experience:
1) Download Python
2) Run the installer. When you first click it, add "Add Pip to PATH" or something, idk.
3) Once that's done, go to the folder, open your Terminal/CMD/Powershell/WSL thing and type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4) Run the yeetbot.py file.
5) You have 10 seconds to open an app and select the text bot. After that, it starts spamming :)
6) To escape, press the escape key.
